## What This Model Does

This is a **complete Medical VQA model** that solves the full Visual Question Answering problem:

### Input
- **Medical Image:** 128×128 grayscale CT/MRI scan (from Autoencoder pathway)
- **Question:** Text question about the image (e.g., "Is there a tumor?", "What organ is shown?")

### Output
- **Answer:** One of 56 CLOSED-ended answers OR one of 431 OPEN-ended answers
  - **CLOSED answers:** Yes/No, multiple choice (56 categories)
  - **OPEN answers:** Free-form textual answers (431 possible answers from dataset)

## Model Architecture

The model uses a sophisticated dual-pathway approach:

### 1. **Visual Encoding (Image Processing)**
```
Medical Image (128×128)
    ↓
[Path 1: MAML Encoder]  +  [Path 2: Autoencoder]
    ↓
Concatenated Visual Features (128-dim)
```

### 2. **Textual Encoding (Question Processing)**
```
Question Text
    ↓
Word Embedding (300-dim)
    ↓
GRU RNN (1024-dim) 
    ↓
Question Embedding (1024-dim)
```

### 3. **Fusion & Attention**
```
Visual + Question Features
    ↓
Bilinear Attention Network (BAN)
    ↓
[CLOSED Branch]        [OPEN Branch]
  BiResNet +              BiResNet +
  Classifier (56)         Classifier (431)
    ↓                          ↓
[CLOSED Answer]          [OPEN Answer]
```

### 4. **Answer Type Detection**
- Type Attention network determines if answer should be CLOSED or OPEN
- Routes question through appropriate classifier

## Model Purpose: VQA vs Classification

### ✅ This Model Does: **FULL VQA**
- Takes **both image AND question** as input
- Outputs **answer** (not just question type)
- Solves end-to-end visual question answering

### ❌ This Model Does NOT Do: **Question-Only Classification**
- The `type_classifier.pth` (separate model) classifies questions only
- This BAN model uses question classification as ONE component, not the whole task

### Key Difference
| Component | Purpose | Trained | Included |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------|
| **Type Classifier** | Classifies question type only | Earlier ✓ | As subroutine |
| **BAN VQA Model** | Answers questions given image+question | Now ✓ | **Full model** |

## How the Model Answers Questions

**Example Workflow:**
```
Input: Image of chest X-ray + "Is there pneumonia?"

1. [Image] → MAML encoder → 64-dim feature
2. [Image] → Autoencoder → 64-dim feature
3. Concatenate features → 128-dim visual representation
4. [Question] → Word embedding → GRU → 1024-dim question embedding
5. Type Attention → Determines answer type (CLOSED for Yes/No)
6. Bilinear Attention → Fuses image + question
7. BiResNet + Classifier → Predicts answer from 56 closed-ended answers
8. Output: "Yes" or "No"
```

## What's Next?

### To Continue Training:
```powershell
# Train for more epochs (e.g., 200 total)
D:/Anaconda/envs/crewai/python.exe main.py --epochs 50 --batch_size 64 --gpu -1 --input saved_models/trained_weights/vqa_model_10epochs.pth
```

### To Use for Inference:
```python
# Load the trained model
model = BAN_Model(dataset, args)
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('saved_models/trained_weights/vqa_model_10epochs.pth'))
model.eval()

# Make predictions
with torch.no_grad():
    output_close, output_open = model(visual_features, question_features, ...)
    prediction = model.classify(output_close, output_open)
```

### Expected Improvements:
- **Epoch 50:** ~60-65% training accuracy
- **Epoch 100:** ~70-75% training accuracy  
- **Epoch 200:** ~80-85%+ training accuracy (plateau may occur)
