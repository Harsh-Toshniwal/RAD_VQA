## Error Analysis

### Top Misclassified Topics (High-confidence errors)
The model shows **51 high-confidence mistakes** (confidence > 0.95):

1. **Vascular Pathology** - Misses aortic abnormalities
   - Example: "Is there evidence of an aortic aneurysm?" → Predicted: NO, Truth: YES
   
2. **Lung Consolidation** - Fails to detect hypo-dense areas
   - Example: "Is there hypo-dense consolidation on the left side?" → Predicted: NO, Truth: YES

3. **Pneumothorax Detection** - Struggles with pneumothorax cases
   - Example: "Is there a left apical pneumothorax?" → Predicted: NO, Truth: YES

4. **Mediastinal Shift** - Incorrectly detects mediastinal deviations
   - Example: "Has the midline of the mediastinum shifted?" → Predicted: YES, Truth: NO

### Error Characteristics
- **Total Incorrect Predictions:** 68 out of 288 analyzed
- **High-Confidence Errors:** 51 (75% of errors)
- **Interpretation:** Model is often overconfident in its predictions

## Recommendations for Model Improvement

1. **Address Overfitting**
   - Increase regularization (higher dropout, L2 penalty)
   - Data augmentation for medical images
   - Reduce model capacity

2. **Improve Pathology Detection**
   - Add domain-specific preprocessing for medical images
   - Consider ensemble methods combining multiple encoders
   - Fine-tune image encoders on pathology-specific features

3. **Calibrate Confidence**
   - Temperature scaling on output logits
   - Mixup or manifold mixup during training
   - Ensemble with disagreement-based uncertainty

4. **Balance Question Types**
   - Address class imbalance in training data
   - Weighted loss function favoring rare pathologies
   - Separate optimized models for OPEN vs CLOSED questions

## Conclusion

The model achieves **67.18% test accuracy** on the RAD dataset with strong performance on binary questions (76.84% CLOSED) but weaker performance on descriptive questions (52.51% OPEN). The model exhibits typical deep learning characteristics: excellent training accuracy (99%) with significant overfitting to the test set. Error patterns suggest the model struggles with critical medical findings, indicating the need for domain-specific improvements.

**Validation:** The evaluation was performed on the full test set (451 samples) with comprehensive per-sample prediction tracking in `test_predictions.json`.
